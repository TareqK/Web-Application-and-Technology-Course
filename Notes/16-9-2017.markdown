## Static Websites

- These Websites were more prevalent when the web was young

- Workflow is like this:

  - User requests the content

  - Server retrieves files from harddisk

  - Server sends HTML and other content to browser

  - Browser renders and displays the files

- The webmaster is responsible for upkeep and maintanence

## Dynamic Websites

- The workflow is as follows
  
  - User requests content
  
  - Server recognises it must run a dynamic script (PHP,JSP,ASP,etc)

  - Server excecutes the script (Using Common Gateway Interface)

  - Script Outputs HTML

  - Server sends the generated HTML and media files to user

  - Browser renders and displays the files.
