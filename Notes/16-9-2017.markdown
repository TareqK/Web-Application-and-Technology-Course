# How the Web Works

- client-server architechture.

- Web is considered a distributed software.

- The browser is programmed to understand and display HTML files.

- You build over the browser when you program for web.

- You Build over the Server when you program for web.

## Static Websites

- These Websites were more prevalent when the web was young.

- The Workflow is as follows:

  - User requests the content.

  - Server retrieves files from harddisk.

  - Server sends HTML and other content to browser.

  - Browser renders and displays the files.

- The webmaster is responsible for upkeep and maintanence.

## Dynamic Websites 

- More prevalent now.

- The Workflow is as follows:
  
  - User requests content.
  
  - Server recognises it must run a dynamic script (PHP,JSP,ASP,etc).

  - Server excecutes the script (Using Common Gateway Interface).

  - Script Outputs HTML.

  - Server sends the generated HTML and media files to user.

  - Browser renders and displays the files.  

- Pages change as inputs change.

## Web 2.0 and Beyond

- Its not a new technology, its a new requirment for web applications to 
give a richer experience. 

- In Web 2.0, web page creation is distributed between clients and servers. This
creates a more interactive web experience such as social media websites.
